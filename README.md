# Unity plugin for Phrase Strings integration

Unity plugin is a package for Unity which allows Unity developers to synchronize their localized strings in Unity with Phrase Strings translation management platform.

## Setup

Phrase Unity plugin relies on Unity Localization package. It assumes that the Unity developer is using or plans to use localization through Unity Localization, in particular [String Table Collections](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@1.5/manual/StringTables.html).

In order to get started with Unity Localization, refer to the [guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@1.5/manual/QuickStartGuideWithVariants.html).

After you create initial set of locales and one or more String Table Collections, and connect them with some text objects (and/or start using them programmatically from your Unity scripts), you can install and start using Phrase Plugin, which can be installed in following ways:

* Install from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/phrase-a-better-way-to-localize-games-294442)
  * Open **Window → Asset Store** (or press `Ctrl+9` / `Cmd+9`)
  * Search for **"Phrase – A Better Way to Localize Games"**
  * Click **Add to My Assets**
  * In Unity Hub or Unity Editor, open **Package Manager** (Window → Package Manager)
  * Select the package under **My Assets** and click **Download** (if not already)
  * Click **Import** to add it into your project
* Install from package archive
  * Assets → Import Package → Custom Package… → choose `.unitypackage` file from disk
* Install from locally checked out source code
  * Either check out the source directly into `YourProject/Packages/com.phrase.plugin` directory, or
  * symlink `unity_plugin` directory into `YourProject/Packages` as `com.phrase.plugin`

Afterwards one should be able to add a Phrase provider asset to their project (Create → Localization → Phrase).
